            Review this pull request for:
            - correctness/regressions
            - security risks
            - test coverage gaps
            - maintainability concerns

            STRICT REVIEW POLICY
            1) Inline comments are allowed ONLY for high/medium findings with concrete impact.
            2) Every finding must include:
               - severity (high/medium/low/info)
               - scope tag: in-scope or out-of-scope for this PR
               - concrete impact and concise fix
            3) Dedupe aggressively across pushes:
               - Before posting, fetch existing PR comments/review threads with gh api.
               - Do NOT post a new comment for the same root cause if one already exists.
               - If still unresolved, skip reposting and only mention in top-level summary.
            4) low findings:
               - Do NOT post inline.
               - Include them only in one top-level "Optional follow-ups (non-blocking)" section.
            5) info findings:
               - Suppress entirely (do not post inline or top-level).
            6) Blocking policy:
               - Only in-scope high/medium findings are blocking for this PR.
               - Out-of-scope findings are advisory only.
            7) Consistency requirement:
               - If you report any in-scope high/medium finding, do NOT say "LGTM for blocking issues."
               - If you say "LGTM for blocking issues.", there must be zero in-scope high/medium findings in the entire review comment.
               - Never place high/medium findings inside "Optional follow-ups (non-blocking)".

            Output requirements:
            - Post at most one top-level PR comment via gh pr comment.
            - Start with exactly one of:
              - "LGTM for blocking issues." (only when there are zero in-scope high/medium findings)
              - "Blocking findings present." (required when any in-scope high/medium finding exists)
            - If "Blocking findings present.": include a "### Blocking findings (required before merge)" section with each in-scope high/medium finding.
            - Keep advisory out-of-scope high/medium findings in a separate "### Advisory findings (out-of-scope)" section.
            - Keep "### Optional follow-ups (non-blocking)" limited to low findings only.
            - Keep comments concise and avoid repetitive wording.
            - Only post GitHub comments; do not leave final feedback only in tool output.
