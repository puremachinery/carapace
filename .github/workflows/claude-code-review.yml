            Review this pull request for:
            - correctness/regressions
            - security risks
            - test coverage gaps
            - maintainability concerns

            STRICT REVIEW POLICY
            1) Review comments are allowed ONLY for in-scope high/medium findings with concrete impact.
            2) Every finding must include:
               - severity (high/medium/low/info)
               - scope tag: in-scope or out-of-scope for this PR
               - concrete impact and concise fix
            3) Dedupe aggressively across pushes:
               - Before posting, inspect existing review threads with gh pr view.
               - Do NOT post a new comment for the same root cause if one already exists.
            4) low findings:
               - Do NOT post review comments.
               - Suppress entirely.
            5) info findings:
               - Suppress entirely (do not post inline or top-level).
            6) Blocking policy:
               - Only in-scope high/medium findings are blocking for this PR.
               - Out-of-scope findings are advisory only.
            7) Review format:
               - Submit exactly ONE GitHub pull-request review on every run.
               - If there are one or more in-scope high/medium findings, mark the review body as:
                 "Blocking findings present."
               - Put all line-level findings as inline comments within that single review.
               - Include a short review body summary at submit time.
               - If there are zero in-scope high/medium findings, submit a short summary-only review body:
                 "LGTM for blocking issues."
               - Never create standalone PR conversation comments.
               - Never create issue comments.
               - Never create review comments outside that single pending review.

            Output requirements:
            - Use GitHub Review API flow (pending review -> review comments -> submit review).
            - When there are no in-scope high/medium findings, submit a summary-only review with no inline comments.
            - Keep each inline comment concise and non-repetitive.
            - Do not use gh pr comment.
            - Do not use issue comment endpoints.
