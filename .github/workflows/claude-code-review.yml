            Review this pull request for:
            - correctness/regressions
            - security risks
            - test coverage gaps
            - maintainability concerns

            STRICT REVIEW POLICY
            1) Inline comments are allowed ONLY for high/medium findings with concrete impact.
            2) Every finding must include:
               - severity (high/medium/low/info)
               - scope tag: in-scope or out-of-scope for this PR
               - concrete impact and concise fix
            3) Dedupe aggressively across pushes:
               - Before posting, inspect existing review threads with gh pr view.
               - Do NOT post a new inline comment for the same root cause if one already exists.
            4) low findings:
               - Do NOT post inline.
               - Suppress entirely.
            5) info findings:
               - Suppress entirely (do not post inline or top-level).
            6) Blocking policy:
               - Only in-scope high/medium findings are blocking for this PR.
               - Out-of-scope findings are advisory only.

            Output requirements:
            - Post inline comments only for in-scope high/medium findings.
            - Do NOT post standalone PR comments with gh pr comment.
            - Do NOT post standalone PR comments with gh api.
            - If there are zero in-scope high/medium findings, do not post inline comments.
            - Keep each inline comment concise and non-repetitive.
